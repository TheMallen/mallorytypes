# Mallorytypes

A next.js/tailwindcss/markdown blog for Mallory Allen. This app serves as a playground for little react things and also as a successor to my old gatsby-based blog. I did my best to be minimalistic and pragmatic, and to use whatever seemed like the easiest tool for every job.

Broadly speaking, feel free to fork this as a basis for your own blog or website. Check out the [license](./LICENSE.md) for details on what you may and may not use.

## Running the Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploying
