Only a few months after ConFoo I found myself given an opportunity to help out at VentureOut in Toronto since Shopify was the primary sponsor this year.

I was excited to go to my first LGBT focused tech conference, and it was definitely a great experience. Despite it's relatively short length and not being able to attend many of the workshops, I had a great time, met some wonderful people, and heard a lot of diverse voices.

## Highlights

### Andrea's talk!

My colleague [Andrea](https://twitter.com/42aross) gave an awesome and inspiring talk about her story, Shopify's [Dev Degree](https://www.mydevlife.ca/) program, and where the industry can head for a more inclusive future.

Oh and of course the blue lantern oath.

### Helping facilitate a workshop

I had the privilege of helping my colleagues run a Design Thinking workshop, and the great fun of seeing a bunch of amazing off the cuff designs made with nothing but craft supplies. It was a really fun time, and a really cool workshop.

### Meeting people

I met some amazing people during my short stay in Toronto. Both through the events and helping run the booth. I listened to survivors tell me their stories, Shopify merchants regail me about their artistic dreams, and experienced business folk spin some tales of their exploits.

I even made some really great friends who I hope to see a lot more of in the future. ðŸ˜¸
