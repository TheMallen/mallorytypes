## This is a blog

For what feels like the 10,000th time I have started my own semi-professional rambling screed website.

Ironically, this comes after a fall which was fraught with repetitive stress issues causing me to miss out on doing any typing-adjacent activites _at all_ for a few weeks. This might make you ask yourself "why would she do this now?".

That is a good question. Maybe I just really want more excuses to type. Maybe I am just a masochist. Regardless, I'll likely be uploading the occasional markdown file to this web-applitudinal liminal space about such things as:

- conferences I attend (as much as conferences are "attended" in this post-apocalyptic dystopia)
- problems I solve at work
- side project progress
- random nerd stuff (magic cards, VR things)
- cute cat pictures

## How I made the blog

This blog was built using [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) with styling via [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and posts written in [mdx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdx-js/react).

I chose these because they make it extremely easy to quickly iterate on apps and handle most of the annoying parts of development for me. I may go further into detail about how to use these things in a subsequent post, or I may forget I said that and not.

## A note on old posts

Reading this you may think to yourself:

> "Wait, I thought she just made this now? Why is there a bunch of posts from 2017?"

To which I say; excellent insight. The secret is, I simply copied over some posts from my previous blog. You can tell these posts since they all belong to the **category** `Legacy`.
